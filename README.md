typeguards - typeof for primatives, instanceof for others

instanceof - allows us to type guard agaisnt types when using unions
| - unions that allow us to accept multiple types

Abstract classes

    cannot create objs directly
    used as parent class
    can contain real methods
    children of this class has to promise to have the methods mentioned

Interface vs Abstract Classes

    interface - sets up contract between diff classes
    use when different object work together
    promotes loose coupling

    inheritance/ abstract classes - sets up contract between diff classes
    use when we are trying to build up a definition of an  obj
    strongly couples classes together

    interfaces are to be used more generally
    ultimately depends on the project
